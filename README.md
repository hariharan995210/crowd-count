# ðŸ‘¥ Real-Time Human Detection and Crowd Counting with YOLOv8

This project performs real-time **human detection** and **crowd density analysis** from a video stream using [Ultralytics YOLOv8](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics). It is designed for applications like event safety, crowd management, and people flow analysis.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Detects **people** in real-time from CCTV or webcam footage
